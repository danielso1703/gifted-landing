      <h1>Gifted Privacy & Security Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: October 27, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>At Gifted, your privacy and security are our top priorities. We are committed to protecting your personal information, ensuring transparency about how it is used, and maintaining high standards of data security. This policy describes how Gifted collects, uses, stores, and protects your data when you use our app, website, and related services.</p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve your experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal information</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account information: name, email address, and profile image (if you log in via Google or Apple). You may also use the app as a guest.</li>
        <li>Preferences: selected recipients, age ranges, budget, and saved searches.</li>
        <li>Interactions: likes, saves, dismisses, shares, and feedback within the app.</li>
        <li>Communications: when you contact us for support or feedback.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Non-personal and technical data</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device information: model, OS version, app version, and unique device identifiers; platform (iOS/Android) stored on sign-in.</li>
        <li>Usage data: in-app activity, session time, and performance logs (for analytics and debugging).</li>
        <li>Cookies or local storage: used only to maintain app state and authentication tokens securely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Optional data</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location: optional; used to detect your country for better gift recommendations.</li>
        <li>Camera/photo: profile photos only (camera and photo library). We do not request contacts permission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Third-party data sources</strong></p>
      <p>Gifted may access or display product data from third-party APIs (e.g., Amazon Product Advertising API, Walmart/Rakuten). We do not store personal user data from these external platforms; product data is refreshed in compliance with API terms.</p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use your information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personalize recommendations and search results.</li>
        <li>Maintain and improve the scoring and recommendation engine.</li>
        <li>Save your searches, preferences, and interaction history.</li>
        <li>Provide support and respond to inquiries.</li>
        <li>Detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.</li>
        <li>Comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We never sell your data to advertisers or unauthorized third parties.</strong></p>

      <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share data only as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With service providers that help us operate the app (e.g., hosting, analytics), under strict agreements.</li>
        <li>When required by law or to protect our rights, users, or safety.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Product links may take you to retailer sites (e.g., Walmart, eBay, Etsy); those retailers have their own privacy policies. See our <a href="affiliate-disclosure.html">Affiliate Disclosure</a> for how we may earn commissions from such links.</p>

      <h2>5. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
      <p>We use cookies or local storage only to maintain app state and authentication tokens securely. We use analytics tools to understand user behavior and app performance in an anonymous or aggregated way. You can opt out of personalized recommendations or analytics tracking in app settings.</p>
      <p>[TODO: If you use specific analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics), name them here.]</p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Data is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes in this policy. Inactive user data may be anonymized or deleted after 12 months of inactivity. Product data fetched from APIs is refreshed every 24 hours to maintain compliance and accuracy.</p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement multiple layers of protection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption: All traffic between your device and our servers uses HTTPS/TLS.</li>
        <li>Access control: Strict authentication and role-based access policies.</li>
        <li>Row-level security (RLS): Each user can access only their own data within our database (Supabase/PostgreSQL).</li>
        <li>Secure authentication: OAuth2 login via Google or Apple — Gifted never stores your password.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Gifted is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us to delete it immediately.</p>

      <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your data may be processed in data centers located outside your country of residence (e.g., the United States or Canada). All transfers comply with applicable privacy laws such as PIPEDA, GDPR, and CCPA, ensuring equivalent levels of data protection.</p>

      <h2>10. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
      <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access: View or export your stored data upon request.</li>
        <li>Correction: Update incorrect or incomplete information.</li>
        <li>Deletion: Permanently delete your account and associated data anytime.</li>
        <li>Opt-out: Disable personalized recommendations or analytics tracking in app settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For requests, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@giftedapp.io">privacy@giftedapp.io</a>.</p>

      <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Gifted integrates with trusted third-party services, each with its own privacy and security commitments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supabase: Secure user authentication, storage, and database management.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>These third parties process data in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>12. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding privacy or security:</p>
