Use this checklist before submitting the Top Notch Gifts landing page for Rakuten Advertising / Walmart Canada affiliate partnership review.

---

## What reviewers look for

- **Real content** — Clear description of the app, no generic or placeholder copy.
- **Clear value proposition** — What Top Notch Gifts does and who it’s for (personalized gift discovery).
- **Working privacy policy** — Full policy page, truthful to the app; link visible in footer and/or main page.
- **Clear affiliate disclosure** — Short, honest disclosure (Rakuten/Walmart Canada); link visible in footer and/or near any “Shop” or outbound links.
- **Visible contact** — Support email and/or website; reviewers must be able to reach you.

## Pre-submission must-haves

Before you submit, confirm:

- [ ] **No “coming soon” emptiness** — Hero, How it works, Features, FAQ, and footer are filled with real copy. No blank or “TBD” sections that would look unfinished.
- [ ] **Screenshots present or acceptable** — At least 3–6 app screenshots in the Screenshots section, or clear placeholders (e.g. labeled “Feed”, “Explore”) if you’re still adding images. Broken images with no labels look unprofessional.
- [ ] **All links work** — Privacy Policy, Affiliate Disclosure, Contact (mailto and/or website), and any CTA (e.g. “Visit Website”) resolve correctly.
- [ ] **Contact email and domain stated** — Footer and/or Contact section show team@topnotchgifts.ca (or your chosen contact) and www.topnotchgifts.ca (or your live domain).
- [ ] **Privacy policy is truthful** — Policy reflects what the app actually collects and shares (Supabase, Amazon, Walmart/Rakuten, etc.). No invented data practices. [TODO] placeholders are filled or removed before submission if they would confuse reviewers.
- [ ] **Affiliate disclosure does not overstate** — Disclosure mentions Rakuten/Walmart Canada and that you may earn commissions; do not claim partnership “approval” or “certification” unless you have it in writing.
- [ ] **Site is publicly accessible** — Deployed at a stable URL (e.g. GitHub Pages, Vercel) that reviewers can open without auth.
